 # My Deep Learning Labs

This repository contains a collection of independent deep learning projects developed as part of my personal learning and experimentation process.
These projects have allowed me to build a deeper and more solid understanding of the models, concepts, and code involved in deep learning.

## Projects
### 1. Flowers Classification

* Exploration and classification of flower images

* Notebooks:

  * Daisy vs Sunflowers (Exploration and classification of a balanced binary subset extracted from the full flowers dataset.)

  * Full Flowers Dataset (🚧 Under Construction)

### 2. Vertebral Dataset

* Classification experiments on vertebral column data

More projects will be added over time.
