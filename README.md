 
# My Deep Learning Labs

These notebooks represent my personal learning process and independent experimentation with deep learning concepts.
The goal of this, is to put into practice the concepts I have learned so far from the following Coursera courses:

1. **Deep Learning Specialization** by DeepLearning.AI  
2. **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate** (Courses 1–8)

These labs allow me to build a deeper and more solid understanding of the concepts, models, and code involved in deep learning.
