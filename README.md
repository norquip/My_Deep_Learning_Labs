 # My Deep Learning Labs

This repository contains a collection of independent deep learning projects developed as part of my personal learning and experimentation process.
These projects have allowed me to build a deeper and more solid understanding of the models, concepts, and code involved in deep learning.

## Projects
### 1. Flowers Classification

This project explores image classification tasks on flower datasets using PyTorch.

#### Notebooks:

  * Daisy vs Sunflowers
    - Exploration and classification of a balanced binary subset extracted from the full flowers dataset.
    - Focus on  generator-based data loading, clean dataset handling and reproducibility.
    - Experiments with different optimizers (Adam vs SGD)

    Notebook: [Daisy_Sun_Adam_SGD](Daisy_Sunflowers/notebooks/DaisySun_Adam_SGD.ipynb)
    
    Poster: [Poster_Daisy_Sunflowers](https://github.com/norquip/My_Deep_Learning_Labs/tree/main/Daisy_Sunflowers/Posters)
 
    
    

  * Full Flowers Dataset
    - Multiclass classification using the full flowers dataset
    - More challenging class imbalance and higher variability
    - 🚧 Work in progress

### 2. Vertebral Classification

* Classification experiment on vertebral column data using PyTorch. The dataset is multiclass and imbalanced. 



### 3.  More projects will be added over time.
